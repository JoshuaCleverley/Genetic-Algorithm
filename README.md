# A python Genetic Algorithm

A genetic algorithm that creates a population of random strings, and over successive generations gets closer and closer to the target string.

This is a very simple project, and it is something I just did quickly for a bit of fun and to understand some basic machine learning concepts. I hope to learn more advance machine learning concepts in the future, and I am planning to learn more about neural networks and how to build them in python.

# Usage
If you want to use this code to explore genetic algorithms to a basic level, feel free to download the code and follow these steps.

Once downloaded, you can either run the code in a python IDE, such as the python IDLE, or you can run it from the command line.
To run this from the command line, simply move to the directory this is downloaded to and type this command:

$ python geneticAlgorithm.py

# TODO
I do plan to add some basic functionality to this program, such as the ability to run it from the command line using arguments as to be able to just skip past the questions when you run the program. Outside of that, it is a simple project and I do not plan to do much with it outside of that.
